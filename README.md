# SCT_WD_4
I'm excited to share my latest web development project, a To-Do web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. The app features an intuitive user interface, enabling users to add, edit, and delete tasks with ease.
